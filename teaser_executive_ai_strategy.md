# Executive AI Strategy Intensive - 2-Page Teaser

---

## PAGE 1: THE CHALLENGE

---

### HEADLINE

**You Have an AI Mandate.**
**But Do You Have a Map?**

---

### SUBHEADLINE

By 2027, UAE government operations must be AI-enabled across all ministries.
The mandate is clear. The path forward is not.

---

### BODY COPY

Every week, another AI vendor walks through your door. Another proposal lands on your desk. Another board meeting where AI is on the agenda.

**The uncomfortable truth?**

Most executives in the GCC are navigating AI decisions while privately uncertain about what "implementing AI" actually means for their organization. They nod in meetings. They approve budgets. They hope their teams know what they're doing.

This isn't a failure of intelligence. It's a failure of preparation.

**The gap is real:**
- Generic AI training teaches tools, not strategy
- Consultants sell solutions before understanding your context
- Your teams can't communicate feasibility upward
- Vendor proposals blur together—hype indistinguishable from capability

**The cost is mounting:**
- Misaligned investments
- Pilots that never reach production
- Capital deployed without clear ROI criteria
- Reputational risk from AI missteps

---

### PULL QUOTE

*"There is a widespread pattern of executives pretending to understand AI while privately feeling uncertain or overwhelmed. This disconnect contributes to inefficient filtering of vendor proposals, misaligned investments, and wasted capital."*

## PAGE 2: THE SOLUTION

---

### HEADLINE

**Strategic Clarity in 2 Days**

An intensive program designed for Ministers, Director Generals, and C-Suite executives who need to lead AI transformation—not just approve it.

---

### WHAT YOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH

**Four Actionable Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | What It Does |
|-------------|--------------|
| **AI Mandate Map** | Translates your generic "implement AI" directive into a concrete, prioritized roadmap for your organization |
| **Investment Filter** | 6-8 questions you can apply to ANY AI proposal to separate real capability from vendor hype |
| **Risk & Governance Guardrail** | Red-line use cases, required approvals, and oversight roles to protect reputation and data |
| **90-Day Action Memo** | One quick win to greenlight immediately + one strategic initiative to explore, ready for board presentation |

---

### FORMAT OPTIONS

| Option | Duration | Structure |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Intensive** | 2 Full Days | On-site in UAE, daytime sessions |
| **Executive Schedule** | 4 Evenings | 3-3.5 hours each, accommodates busy calendars |

---

### WHY THIS PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT

**Practitioner-Led, Not Consultant Theater**
Developed by practitioners who have built and deployed AI systems at scale—not trainers who learned from slides.

**GCC Context, Not Western Translation**
Case studies from UAE ministries, state-owned enterprises, and regional contexts. Arabic co-facilitation available.

**Organizational Coherence**
Part of a three-tier program that aligns executives, middle managers, and technical staff. When you speak, your teams understand. When they propose, you can evaluate.

**UAE HR Accreditation Pathway**
Certificate aligned with UAE career advancement structures.

---

### THE CORE QUESTION THIS PROGRAM ANSWERS

*"I have a mandate to implement AI, but I don't have a clear map of what that actually means for my organization. How do I turn this mandate into concrete, low-risk, high-value action?"*

If this question resonates, this program provides the strategic framework, practical tools, and actionable plan to answer it with confidence.
